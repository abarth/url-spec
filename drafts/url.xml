      <t>This document contains a precise specification of how browsers process
      URLs.  The behavior specified in this document might or might not match
      any particular browser, but browsers might be well-served by adopting the
      behavior defined herein.</t>

    <section title="Open Issues">
      <t>Browsers parse URLs differently depending on which operating system
      they're running on.  The problem is that they want to do sensible things
      for file paths, but file paths look different on Windows and Unix
      systems.</t>

      <t>How should we handle cases where browsers disaggree with the regular
      expression in RFC 3986?  Currently, this document aims to describe how
      browsers behave, but we'll likely need to compare that to RFC 3986 at
      some point.  Some specific differences that have been brought up on the
      mailing list:

      <t>A control character is a character whose value is less than or equal
      to U+0020 (" ").</t>

      <t>A slash character is either U+???? ("/") or U+???? ("\"). TODO:
